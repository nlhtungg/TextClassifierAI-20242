Johnson, AP", "date": "2022-09-23", "content": "LOADING\nERROR LOADING\nU.S. health officials say 4.4 million Americans have rolled up their sleeves for the\nupdated COVID-19 booster shot.\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention posted the count Thursday as public health experts bemoaned President\nJoe Biden\n’s\nrecent remark\nthat “the pandemic is over.”\nThe White House said more than 5 million people received the new boosters by its own estimate that accounts for reporting lags in states.\nAdvertisement\nHealth experts said it is too early to predict whether demand would match up with the 171 million doses of the new boosters the U.S. ordered for the fall.\n“No one would go looking at our flu shot uptake at this point and be like, ‘Oh, what a disaster,’” said Dr. David Dowdy, an infectious disease epidemiologist at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. “If we start to see a large uptick in cases, I think we’re going to see a lot of people getting the (new COVID) vaccine.”\nA temporary shortage of Moderna vaccine caused some pharmacies to cancel appointments while encouraging people to reschedule for a Pfizer vaccine. The issue was expected to resolve as government regulators wrapped up an inspection and cleared batches of vaccine doses for distribution.\nAdvertisement\n“I do expect this to pick up in the weeks ahead,” said White House COVID-19 coordinator Dr. Ashish Jha. “We’ve been thinking and talking about this as an annual vaccine like the flu vaccine. Flu vaccine season picks up in late September and early October. We’re just getting our education campaign going. So we expect to see, despite the fact that this was a strong start, we actually expect this to ramp up stronger.”\nSome Americans who plan to get the shot, designed to target the most common omicron strains, said they are waiting because they either had COVID-19 recently or another booster. They are following public health advice to wait several months to get the full benefit of their existing virus-fighting antibodies.\nOthers are scheduling shots closer to holiday gatherings and winter months when respiratory viruses spread more easily.\nAdvertisement\nRyan Dutton, an EMT from Rescue Inc., prepares shots of the Pfizer booster of the COVID-19 vaccine during a vaccine clinic held by Rescue Inc. at Leland & Gray Middle and High School, in Townshend, Vt., on Sept. 20, 2022.\nKristopher Radder/The Brattleboro Reformer via Associated Press\nRetired hospital chaplain Jeanie Murphy, 69, of Shawnee, Kansas, plans to get the new booster in a couple of weeks after she has some minor knee surgery. Interest is high among her neighbors from what she sees on the Nextdoor app.\n“There’s quite a bit of discussion happening among people who are ready to make appointments,” Murphy said. “I found that encouraging. For every one naysayer there will be 10 or 12 people who jump in and say, ‘You’re crazy. You just need to go get the shot.’”\nAdvertisement\nBiden later acknowledged criticism of his remark about the pandemic being over and clarified the pandemic is “not where it was.” The initial comment didn’t bother Murphy. She believes the disease has entered a steady state when “we’ll get COVID shots in the fall the same as we do flu shots.”\nExperts hope she’s right, but are waiting to see what levels of infection winter brings. The summer ebb in case numbers, hospitalizations and deaths may be followed by another surge, Dowdy said.\nDr. Anthony Fauci, asked Thursday by a panel of biodefense experts what still keeps him up at night, noted that half of vaccinated Americans never got an initial booster dose.\nAdvertisement\n“We have a vulnerability in our population that will continue to have us in a mode of potential disruption of our social order,” Fauci said. “I think that we have to do better as a nation.”\nSome Americans who got the new shots said they are excited about the idea of targeting the vaccine to the variants circulating now.\n“Give me all the science you can,” said Jeff Westling, 30, an attorney in Washington, D.C., who got the new booster and a flu shot on Tuesday, one in each arm. He participates in the combat sport jujitsu, so wants to protect himself from infections that may come with close contact. “I have no issue trusting folks whose job it is to look at the evidence.”\nAdvertisement\nMeanwhile, Biden’s pronouncement in a “60 Minutes” interview broadcast Sunday echoed through social media.\n“We still have a problem with COVID. We’re still doing a lot of work on it. But the pandemic is over,” Biden said while walking through the Detroit auto show. “If you notice, no one’s wearing masks. Everybody seems to be in pretty good shape. And so I think it’s changing.”\n“The pandemic is over. We still have a problem with COVID. We’re still doing a lot of work on it. But the pandemic is over,” President Biden tells 60 Minutes in an interview in Detroit.\nhttps://t.co/7SixTE3OMT\npic.twitter.com/s5fyjRpYuX\n— 60 Minutes (@60Minutes)\nSeptember 19, 2022\nAdvertisement\nBy Wednesday on\nFacebook\n, when a Kansas health department posted where residents could find the new booster shots, the first commenter remarked snidely:\n“But Biden says the pandemic is over.”\nThe president’s statement, despite his attempts to clarify it, adds to public confusion, said Josh Michaud, associate director of global health policy with the Kaiser Family Foundation in Washington.\n“People aren’t sure when is the right time to get boosted. ‘Am I eligible?’ People are often confused about what the right choice is for them, even where to search for that information,” Michaud said.\nAdvertisement\n“Any time you have mixed messages, it’s detrimental to the public health effort,” Michaud said. “Having the mixed messages from the president’s remarks, makes that job that much harder.”\nUniversity of South Florida epidemiologist Jason Salemi said he’s worried the president’s pronouncement has taken on a life of its own and may stall prevention efforts.\n“That soundbite is there for a while now, and it’s going to spread like wildfire. And it’s going to give the impression that ‘Oh, there’s nothing more we need to do,’” Salemi said.\nAdvertisement\n“If we’re happy with 400 or 500 people dying every single day from COVID, there’s a problem with that,” Salemi said. “We can absolutely do better because most of those deaths, if not all of them, are absolutely preventable with the tools that we have.”\nNew York City photographer Vivienne Gucwa, 44, got the new booster Monday. She’s had COVID twice, once before vaccines were available and again in May. She was vaccinated with two Moderna shots, but never got the original boosters.\n“When I saw the new booster was able to tackle omicron variant I thought, ‘I’m doing that,’” Gucwa said.\nAdvertisement\n“I don’t want to deal with omicron again. I was kind of thrilled to see the boosters were updated.”\n___\nAP Medical Writer Lauran Neergaard and AP White House Correspondent Zeke Miller contributed. ___\nThe Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Department of Science Education.

He was charged Thursday with one count of\ninterference with flight crew members and attendants\n, which carries a maximum penalty of up to 20 years in prison, said a statement by the\nU.S. Attorney’s Office\nfor the Central District of California.\nAccording to the statement, Le grabbed a flight attendant’s shoulder and demanded coffee about 20 minutes after the aircraft took off. He also allegedly disrupted passengers by hanging out near the first-class section of the cabin.\nWhen another flight attendant told Le to return to his assigned seat, Le “allegedly stood up and assumed a fighting stance towards the flight attendant by making closed fists with both of his hands, which the flight attendant interpreted as a threat,” according to the DOJ statement.\nA video taken by fellow passenger Barrie Livingstone shows Le apparently initially swinging his arm at the flight attendant but missing. As the attendant turned to walk away, Le can be seen rushing forward to strike the attendant in the head, eliciting cries of concern and outrage on the aircraft. The attack was “witnessed by several passengers,” the Justice Department said.\nLe then “fled” to the back of the plane, where he was “apprehended by several passengers” and crew members, the statement added.\nLe’s “hands and legs were cuffed,” but he “continuously unbuckled his seatbelt, causing flight attendants to restrain him to the seat with seatbelt extenders,” officials noted.\nLe has been barred from all future flights by American Airlines.\n“Acts of violence against our team members are not tolerated by American Airlines,” said a statement from American. “The individual involved in this incident will never be allowed to travel with us in the future, and we will work closely with law enforcement in their investigation.”\nThe airline thanked crew members and passengers for restraining Le until the aircraft was met by law enforcement at LAX.\nLe appeared Thursday at the U.S. District Court in downtown Los Angeles, where he was charged.\nThe hearing was continued to Monday, Ciaran McEvoy, a spokesperson for the U.S. attorney’s office, told\nSFGate\n. “That will be a\ndetention hearing\nto determine his bond, if any. Mr. Le has not pleaded to anything yet,” McEvoy added.\nAttacks on flight attendants have skyrocketed in the last two years, largely triggered by sometimes violent, defiant responses to requirements to wear masks earlier in the COVID-19 pandemic. The Federal Aviation Administration logged an incredible\n5,981 “unruly passenger reports\nlast year. In 2020, the FAA\ninvestigated only 183 reports\n.\nGo Ad-Free — And Protect The Free Press\nThe next four years will change America forever.

We continue to believe the company responded appropriately,” a representative for Franklin Templeton said in a statement to HuffPost.\nThe company\nannounced Cooper’s termination\non social media shortly after video of her May 2020 encounter with a man named Christian Cooper ― with whom she shares no relation ― went viral. He had asked her to leash her dog in the park, prompting the woman to call 911 and accuse the bird-watcher of threatening her.\nAmy Cooper is shown with her dog in a viral video from May 2020.\nvia Associated Press\nAdvertisement\n“I’m going to tell them there’s an African American man threatening my life,” she said in the video.\nProsecutors, who charged her with filing a false report, said that Cooper also made a second 911 call in which she claimed that a Black man “tried to assault her in the Ramble area of the park.” A judge last year\nagreed to drop the criminal charge\nagainst her after she completed five sessions of an educational program that included instruction about racial bias.\nFranklin Templeton quickly placed Cooper on administrative leave over the incident, before\ntweeting\nthat the company had fired her after an internal review.\n“We do not tolerate racism of any kind at Franklin Templeton,” it said at the time.\nCooper’s lawsuit accused the company of making defamatory statements against her in that tweet and claimed that an internal investigation was not performed.\nAdvertisement\nAmy Cooper calls police in the viral video.\nvia Associated Press\nHowever, Abrams ruled that merely watching video of the incident and holding a discussion within the company would “meet a reasonable interpretation of ‘internal review.’”\n“Plaintiff may take issue with the sufficiency of Defendants’ investigation into the incident, but she has not plausibly alleged that no investigation was conducted at all,” the judge said this week.\nAdvertisement\nIf someone inferred that the company was calling Cooper a racist in its tweet, that would constitute “protected opinion,” according to Abrams.\n“It is well-established that an accusation of bigotry is a protected statement of opinion, rather than a defamatory statement of fact capable of being proven true or false,” she said.\nGo Ad-Free — And Protect The Free Press\nThe next four years will change America forever.

Earlier, she had blasted the song “Hijos del Canaveral” (“Sons of the Sugarcane Field”), written by Puerto Rican hip-hop star René Pérez as an ode to Puerto Rico and its people’s bravery.\n“I needed a shot of patriotism,” she said. “I needed strength to do this once again.”\nVeguilla had waited in line Tuesday, only to be told that the water had run out and that another truck would not be available until Wednesday.\nAdvertisement\nSome people ahead of Veguilla gave up and drove away, with tensions running high the longer people waited.\n“Move!” yelled one driver, fearful of people trying to cut in.\nSome who saw the line opted instead to drive to a nearby highway where fresh water trickled down the mountainside via a bamboo pipe that someone had installed.\nGreg Reyes, an English teacher, stood in line in muddy flip-flops to collect water for himself, his girlfriend and their cat. He had brought a large bag holding all the empty containers he could find in their house, including more than a dozen small water bottles.\nAdvertisement\nReyes said he and his partner had been buying water since Fiona hit, but couldn’t afford to do so any longer.\nStanding behind him was retiree William Rodríguez, surrounded by three large buckets and four gallon containers. He had been living in Massachusetts and decided to return to Puerto Rico about six months ago.\n“But I think I’m leaving again,” he said as he shook his head.\nThose in the line grumbled about the slow pace of recovery and accused the government of not helping them as people on social media and even a gym said their doors were open to anyone who needed water or a shower.\nAdvertisement\n“This hasn’t been easy,” said Juan Santos, a retiree who held the hand of his 5-year-old grandson. “We are suffering.”\nNone of those in line had power either, and many wondered if it would take as long to restore as it did with Hurricane Maria.\nPower company officials initially said it would take a few days for electricity to be restored, but then appeared to backtrack Tuesday night, saying they faced numerous obstacles.\nAdvertisement\n“Hurricane Fiona has severely impacted electrical infrastructure and generation facilities throughout the island. We want to make it very clear that efforts to restore and reenergize continue and are being affected by severe flooding, impassable roads, downed trees, deteriorating equipment, and downed lines,” said Luma, the company that operates power transmission and distribution.\nOfficials said crews found several substations underwater and inaccessible.\nBut Luma said it expected to restore power Wednesday to much of Puerto Rico’s north coast, which Fiona largely spared.\nThe hum of generators could be heard across the territory as people became increasingly exasperated.\n“I continue to hope that by the end of today, a large part of the population will have these services,” said Puerto Rico Gov. Pedro Pierluisi.\nAdvertisement\nThe head of the Federal Emergency Management Agency traveled to Puerto Rico on Tuesday and the agency announced it was sending hundreds of additional personnel to boost local response efforts. On Wednesday, U.S. President\nJoe Biden\napproved a major disaster declaration, which would allow for more federal assistance.\nMeanwhile, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services declared a public health emergency in Puerto Rico and deployed a couple of teams to the island.\nIn the Turks and Caicos Islands, officials reported relatively light damage and no deaths, though the eye of the Category 4 storm passed close to Grand Turk, the small British territory’s capital island, on Tuesday.\nAdvertisement\n“Turks and Caicos had a phenomenal experience over the past 24 hours,” said Deputy Gov. Anya Williams. “It certainly came with its share of challenges.”\nOfficials said school on Grand Turk would reopen next week.\nThe Hurricane Center said Fiona had maximum sustained winds of 130 mph (215 kph) late Wednesday. It was centered about 550 miles (885 kilometers) southwest of Bermuda, heading north at 10 mph (17 kph).\nFiona killed a man in the French overseas department of Guadeloupe and two others in Puerto Rico swept away by swollen rivers. Two died in the Dominican Republic: one killed by a falling tree and the other by a falling electric post.\nAdvertisement\nTwo additional deaths were reported in Puerto Rico as a result of the blackout: A 70-year-old man burned to death after he tried to fill his running generator with gasoline and a 78-year-old man police say inhaled toxic gases from his generator.\n___\nAssociated Press journalists Maricarmen Rivera Sánchez and Alejandro Granadillo contributed to this report.\nRelated\nHurricane fiona\nJennifer Lopez, Lin-Manuel Miranda And Others Call For Puerto Rico Aid After Hurricane Fiona\nFiona Threatens To Become Category 4 Storm Headed To Bermuda\nStunning Photos Show Damage Left In Hurricane Fiona's Wake\nGo to Homepage\nLEAVE A COMMENT\nSuggest a correction\n|\nSubmit a tip\nAdvertisement\nFrom Our Partner\nFrom Our Partner\nHuffPost Shopping's\nBest Finds\nNewsletter Sign Up\nThe Morning Email\nWake up to the day's most important news.

It takes a lot of courage to make your own path.”\nThat line of narration from the new documentary “Mija” — spoken by one of its subjects, musician and music manager Doris Muñoz — has stuck with me for months since its\nSundance Film Festival\npremiere in January.\nAdvertisement\nThe documentary follows Muñoz and two of her clients: first, singer/songwriter Cuco and later, singer/songwriter Jacks Haupt. Muñoz’s success as a manager representing fellow Latinx artists has provided material support to her family. In the film, her parents are undergoing the arduous and bureaucratic process of applying for green cards. Muñoz, the only U.S.-born member of her immediate family, is also the liaison between them and her brother, who lives across the border in Tijuana after he was deported.\nIn “Mija,” Muñoz and Haupt grapple with a lot of complicated feelings that are familiar to many children of immigrants, especially those trying to make it in a creative profession. They want to live up to their parents’ expectations and make them proud, and feel obligated to help them and honor their enormous sacrifices. Amid all of that, they’re figuring out how to make it in a field where there aren’t a lot of people like them.\nPremiering Friday on Disney+, “Mija” is the feature debut of director Isabel Castro. She previously spent a decade in journalism, producing documentary shorts and series at the New York Times, the Marshall Project and VICE, where she was an Emmy-nominated producer for “VICE News Tonight.” As she explained in an interview, the seed for “Mija” came from a desire to tell more nuanced stories about immigration — not just about the act of immigrating or the policies behind it, but the complex emotions it brings up and “the ripple effects across different generations.”\nAdvertisement\nIsabel Castro, the director of \"Mija.\"\nJackie Russo\n“The range of emotions that comes along with immigrating to this country is really, really nuanced and complicated, and the spectrum is really wide,” she said. “Oftentimes, immigrant stories are very narrowly focused on exclusively the trauma of that experience.”\nIt’s the kind of story Castro has wanted to tell for many years, and the intersection of several of her creative goals. As a Mexican American journalist covering immigration and civil rights in the Trump era, Castro “started to feel really disillusioned by the kind of aspirations towards objectivity,” she said. “Just looking at the ways that different government policies were affecting folks on the ground, it was very difficult for me to really try to maintain objectivity.”\nAdvertisement\nCastro, who has a background in filmmaking but cut her teeth in journalism and documentary TV work to build a more steady career path, quit her day job and used her savings to get back into independent film. She took a course in cinematography to be able to work independently and reduce costs, since getting a film funded can be a long and cumbersome process.\nWhen considering what story she wanted to tell, she remembered that “I’ve always loved music docs. So I thought, ‘Oh, maybe there’s a way to have a music doc intersect with a story about immigration,’” she said. “And that’s kind of the seed that was planted.”\nIn 2019, Castro came across\na\nCalifornia Sunday magazine profile\nabout Cuco, which mentioned the work Muñoz was doing as his manager. After several phone conversations with Muñoz, Castro met her in person later that year at “\nSelena for Sanctuary\n,” a concert paying homage to the late singer and icon Selena. A few years earlier, Muñoz began the event as a way to raise money for her parents’ legal fees, and later grew it into a fundraiser for immigrant rights organizations. Soon after the two met, Muñoz agreed to be part of the documentary.\nAdvertisement\nDoris Muñoz and Jacks Haupt lay on a multicolored blanket in the grass, in a scene from the documentary \"Mija.\"\nDisney\nWhen deciding to move away from journalism and make her own feature film, Castro also wanted to be able to make more specific stylistic choices. “There’s objectivity, also, in the vernacular of imagery that journalism is told in. And I wanted to make something that felt really subjective, that felt really intentional about its POV and about the image itself being part of the messaging and the story,” she said.\nFor instance, “Mija” features a vibrant color palette and dream-like sequences, which were inspired by HBO’s “Euphoria.” “In terms of trying to react to or deviate from the typical ways that immigrant stories are told, I really wanted to adopt a visual language that felt really young and exciting, and so I looked a lot to ‘Euphoria,’” she said.\nAdvertisement\nIn choosing to have Muñoz narrate the documentary, Castro drew from the voiceover of characters like Cher Horowitz in “Clueless” and Carrie Bradshaw in “Sex and the City,” which she loved as a teen. “I really connected to Carrie and Cher, despite our huge differences, just because of the VO. I felt like there was an intimacy that was established through the voiceover,” she said. “So I always knew that I wanted to emulate that in the voiceover for the film.”\nLike everything else in the world, the pandemic shifted Muñoz’s life and the course of the documentary, forcing Castro to get creative with the production limitations.\n“\nI went into this thinking it would be a more traditional music doc. I thought I’d be on the road. I thought it was going to be a Chicano ‘Almost Famous,’” she said. “But the pandemic hit, and my expectations just completely went out the window.”\nWhile we didn’t get that road movie version of “Mija,” the film’s intimate moments of reflection lend itself well to the complicated questions it explores — the kind that don’t fit into a pithy headline or neat narrative.\nAdvertisement\nFor children of immigrants, in some ways, perhaps the ultimate gift to our parents is to get to make the choices they couldn’t, and to be able to move beyond basic questions of survival and material needs. But it also can be hard for our parents to understand our choices, and we can feel a sense of guilt for being able to focus on less material concerns than they did.\n“One of the emotions that I personally carry with me and most wanted to explore in this was the feeling of guilt,” Castro said. “And I think that that’s particularly prevalent in the stories of immigrants because migration just is inherently a traumatic experience. No matter what your story is, it’s a decision to leave your home, and it’s a decision to leave your country and your culture and move to a new place. And it’s painful.”\n“And I think that as children of immigrants, oftentimes you see that pain or interpret that pain, and you want to honor it,” she continued. “And sometimes, that comes along with a lot of pressure, and that pressure often comes along with feelings of guilt. So I wanted to explore those kinds of emotions. I wanted the film to live not just exclusively in the trauma of immigration, because that’s always going to be there in our lives, in our stories and in our day-to-day experiences.”\nAdvertisement\nCastro wants more immigration stories to capture these more complicated feelings and questions.\n“The nuanced emotions are the ones that I think come up more often on a day-to-day basis,” she continued. “Having covered immigration for many, many years, that is the reality of most people’s experiences that I see. It’s not something black and white.”\n“Mija” premieres Friday on Disney+.\nRelated\nMusic\nFilm\nLatine Heritage Month 2022\nThe Sundance Movies And Performances You Won't Want To Miss\nWomen Of Color Remain Starkly Underrepresented Among Hollywood’s Top Directors\nRapper Latashá Is Creating A Space In Crypto For Indie Artists\nHow Woodstock ‘99 Epitomized White Male Gatekeeping In Alt-Rock\nObama Marks DACA’s 10th Anniversary In Conversation With Dreamers\nGo to Homepage\nLEAVE A COMMENT\nSuggest a correction\n|\nSubmit a tip\nAdvertisement\nFrom Our Partner\nFrom Our Partner\nHuffPost Shopping's\nBest Finds\nNewsletter Sign Up\nEntertainment\nDon't miss a beat.

Administration concerns grow by the day that time is running short to revive the\nIran nuclear deal\nand over China’s saber-rattling on Taiwan.\nWhen he addressed last year’s General Assembly,\nBiden focused on broad themes of global partnership, urging world leaders to act with haste against the coronavirus, climate change and human rights abuses. And he offered assurances that his presidency marked a return of American leadership to international institutions following\nDonald Trump\n’s “America First” foreign policy.\nAdvertisement\nBut one year later, global dynamics have dramatically changed.\nStewart Patrick, senior fellow and director of the Global Order and Institutions Program at the Washington think tank Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, wrote in an\nanalysis\nthat Biden’s task this year is “immense” compared to his first address to the U.N. as president.\n“Last year, the U.S. leader won easy plaudits as the ‘anti-Trump,’ pledging that ‘America was back,’” Patrick said. “This year demands more. The liberal, rules-based international system is reeling, battered by Russian aggression, Chinese ambitions, authoritarian assaults, a halting pandemic recovery, quickening climate change, skepticism of the U.N.’s relevance, and gnawing doubts about American staying power.”\nBeyond diplomacy, the president is also doing some politicking. This year’s gathering comes less than seven weeks before\npivotal midterm elections\nin the United States. Shortly after arriving in Manhattan on Tuesday night, Biden spoke at a Democratic National Committee fundraiser for about 100 participants that raised nearly $2 million, and he’s set to hold another fundraiser on Thursday before heading back to Washington.\nAdvertisement\nHis Wednesday address comes on the heels of Ukrainian forces\nretaking control of large stretches of territory\nnear Kharkiv. But even as Ukrainian forces have racked up battlefield wins, much of Europe is feeling painful blowback from economic sanctions levied against Russia. A vast reduction in Russian oil and gas has led to a sharp jump in energy prices, skyrocketing inflation and growing risk of Europe slipping into a recession.\nBiden’s visit to the U.N. also comes as his administration’s efforts to revive the 2015 Iran nuclear deal appears stalled.\nThe deal brokered by the Obama administration — and scrapped by Trump in 2018 — provided billions of dollars in sanctions relief in exchange for Iran’s agreement to dismantle much of its nuclear program and open its facilities to extensive international inspection.\nAdvertisement\nSullivan said no breakthrough with Iran is expected during the General Assembly but Biden would make clear in his speech that a deal can still be done “if Iran is prepared to be serious about its obligations.” He added that administration officials would be consulting with fellow signatories of the 2015 deal on the sidelines of this week’s meetings.\nMarine One carrying President Joe Biden arrives to land at the Wall Street landing zone in lower Manhattan in New York on Sept. 20, 2022.\nMANDEL NGAN via Getty Images\nThis year’s U.N. gathering is back to being a full-scale, in-person event after two years of curtailed activity due to the pandemic. In 2020, the in-person gathering was canceled and leaders instead delivered prerecorded speeches; last year was a mix of in-person and prerecorded speeches. Biden and first lady Jill Biden were set to host a leaders’ reception on Wednesday evening.\nAdvertisement\nChina’s President Xi Jinping opted not to attend this year’s U.N. gathering, but his country’s conduct and intentions will loom large during the leaders’ talks.\nLast month, the U.N. human rights office raised concerns about possible\n“crimes against humanity”\nin China’s western region against Uyghurs and other largely Muslim ethnic groups. Beijing has vowed to suspend cooperation with the office and blasted what it described as a Western plot to undermine China’s rise.\nMeanwhile, China’s government on Monday said Biden’s statement in a CBS “60 Minutes” interview that American forces\nwould defend Taiwan\nif Beijing tried to invade the self-ruled island was a violation of U.S. commitments on the matter, but it gave no indication of possible retaliation.\nAdvertisement\nThe White House said after the interview that there has been no change in U.S. policy on Taiwan, which China claims as its own. That policy says Washington wants to see Taiwan’s status resolved peacefully but doesn’t say whether U.S. forces might be sent in response to a Chinese attack.\n___\nFollow AP coverage of the U.N.
